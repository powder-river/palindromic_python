* [] Blank slate
  * [ ] Create a GitHub repo called `palindromic`
  * [ ] Put a `README.md` file in it and copy palindrome.py and palindrome_test.py from this repository into it.
* [ ] Normal Mode
  * [ ] Write your `main()` function to ask the user for a word/sentence, pass it into the is_palindrome function, and state whether or not the the sentence is palindromic
  * [ ] Write your `is_palindrome` function **using recursion**
  * [ ] Run palindrome_test.py and ensure you pass all the tests
* [ ] Hard Mode (optional)
  * [ ] Make an iterative version of your `is_palindrome` function (using loops instead of recursion), and ensure it passes the tests too
